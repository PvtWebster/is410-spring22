/*Exercise 1*//*
1. Explain the effect of the following SQL statement:
UPDATE sales.Order_Details 
SET QuotedPrice = QuotedPrice * 1.32
WHERE OrderNumber IN ( 
    SELECT OrderNumber 
    FROM sales.Orders 
    WHERE DATEPART(year, OrderDate) = '2018')

*****ANSWER*****
This SQL statement is _increasing_ the 'Quoted Price' for all orders that were placed in 2018 by 32%. So for example, if the quoted price was 100, the new price would be 132 after this update.

/*Exercise 2*//*
2. Explain the effect of the following SQL statement:
INSERT INTO sales.Customers (CustFirstName, CustLastName, CustStreetAddress, CustCity, CustState, CustZipCode, CustAreaCode, CustPhoneNumber) 
VALUES('Juli', 'Lisser', '2300 E Kenwood Blvd', 'Milwaukee', 'WI', '53211', 414, '484-8592')

*****ANSWER*****
This SQL statement is adding a new row to the sales.Customers table. When inserting, the columns and the values to be inserted into those columns must be order specified; in this case, 'Juli' will be inserted into 'CustFirstName', 'Lisser' into 'CustLastName', and so forth. If the order is not correctly aligned, nondesired values will be inserted into the wrong columns. 

/*Exercise 3*//*
3. Explain the effect of the following SQL statement: 
DELETE FROM school.Subjects 
WHERE SubjectID IN ( 
    SELECT s.SubjectID 
    FROM school.Subjects AS s 
        LEFT JOIN school.Faculty_Subjects AS fs 
            ON s.SubjectID = fs.SubjectID 
    WHERE fs.StaffID IS NULL)

--*****ANSWER*****
This DELETE statment is intended to delete any rows from school.Subjects table that do not have a faculty member assigned to teach the course: checking if 'fs.StaffID IS NULL'. In this particular example, only one row will be removed and that is 'JRN 104' which is College Publications.

*****ANSWER*****
This script first creates the database named 'DemoDB'. Then next creates a table, named 'Students', and defines 9 columns for that table and what kind of data types belong to those columns. Column 'student_id' is defined as the primary key, which is why it's declared as 'NOT NULL'. */

    play_num INT,
    player_type VARCHAR(50),
    CONSTRAINT game_plays_players_id PRIMARY KEY (game_id, play_id, player_id)

*****ANSWER*****
 This script creates the database 'NHLData'. It then defines the columns and what data types belong to those columns. 'game_id', 'play_id', and 'player_id' are defined as foreign keys and what 'table(column)' refer to. This is summarized at the bottom with 'CONSTRAINT' as a composite primary key for this table. */
